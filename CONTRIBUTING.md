## Where to go with problems

If you're having trouble using Winnie, you might find the answer in the [documentation](https://github.com/aigeroni/Winnie_Docs).  Otherwise, you can join the [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/mvZZMhK) to get help from the core team and members of the community.

If you think that you've found a problem in the code, you can report bugs by opening an [issue](https://github.com/lisushka/Winnie_Bot/issues) on GitHub.

## Making improvements

### Code

#### Requirements

You'll need the following dependencies to develop Winnie locally:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.0 or higher
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io//)

#### Running Winnie for local development

<ol>
  <li>
    Clone the repo, and open the repo directory:
    <br>
    <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/aigeroni/Winnie_Bot.git winnie_bot && cd winnie_bot</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Install dependencies with <code>pnpm</code>:
    <br>
    <pre>$ pnpm install</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create <code>.env</code> file:
    <br>
    <pre>$ cp .env.sample .env</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Setup your environment variables in the <code>.env</code> file:
  </li>
  <li>
    Start the Docker processes:
    <br>
    <pre>$ docker-compose up -d</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the migrations to set up the database:
    <br>
    <pre>$ pnpm typeorm migration:run</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Start Winnie:
    <br>
    <pre>$ pnpm start</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In seperate terminal windows, start the job workers:
    <br>
    <pre>$ pnpm start:worker:goal</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

#### `package.json` scripts

You can use the following scripts on your local CLI to complete tasks:

* `pnpm build` - Compile Winnie's TypeScript code into plain JavaScript
* `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint over Winnie's code
* `pnpm lint:fix` - Run ESLint over Winnie's code, fixing basic linting errors
* `pnpm start` - Compile Winnie and start up the bot process
* `start:worker:goal` - Start the goals worker, needed for goals to complete.
* `pnpm typeorm` - Access the [TypeORM CLI](https://typeorm.io/#/using-cli)

#### Code standards

We use the following standards whilst coding:

* `ts-standard` for linting TypeScript files
* `terraform fmt` for linting Terraform infrastructure as code

We favour heavily commented code; this makes it easier for all of our contributors to understand how Winnie works.  We may ask you to improve your comments if we think that they need to be clearer.

#### Pull requests

Pull requests should explain what you've done at a high level.  If you're making major changes to the code, then a detailed explanation in both the pull request and the comments is ideal.

We have a pull request template, which you can edit accordingly.  Feel free to delete any headings that aren't relevant.

### Documentation

If you want to update Winnie's documentation, you'll need to submit a pull request in the [docs repo](https://github.com/aigeroni/Winnie_Docs).  You can find instructions for doing so there.

If you're struggling with doing so, join the [community server](https://discord.gg/mvZZMhK), and come and find us in the `#website-documentation` channel to get help.

### Translations

#### Languages

Winnie is currently available in seven languages:

* English
* Fran√ßais
* Magyar
* Latina
* Bahasa Melayu
* Nederlands
* Svenska

#### Files

The translation framework consists of the following files:

* `winnie.json` - Miscellanous translations that don't better fit in another file
* `challenges.json` - Challenge-related messages
* `commands.json` - Command responses
* `goals.json` - Goal-related messages
* `prompts.json` - Story prompts

#### Improving an existing translation

For extensive changes to an existing translation, please join our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/mvZZMhK), go to the `#new_features` channel, and tag `@Core Team` with the language whose translation you want to improve.  We'll connect you with the existing translators for the language, and help you to get set up with our frameworks.

For minor changes, use the following instructions:

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">Fork</a> the Winnie_Bot repo and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/.free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> it to your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the file containing the messages you want to correct in your favorite text editor. For help finding the right translation file, see <a href="files">here</a>.
    <br>
    <em>**NOTE:** We recommend a program like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.  Word processing applications, such as LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word, and WordPerfect, add extra information to the text that prevents Winnie from parsing it properly.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the string that you want to change, and edit it accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit">Commit</a> your changes and <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-push">push</a> them to your fork.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a> back to Winnie with your changes.
  </li>
</ol>

#### Translating Winnie into a new language

If you want to help translate Winnie into a language she does not currently support, please join our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/mvZZMhK), go to the `#new_features` channel, and tag `@Core Team` with the language that you want to translate Winnie into.  We'll then set up localisation files for your language, and help you to get set up with our frameworks.
