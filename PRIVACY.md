# `Winnie_Bot` Privacy Policy

The `Winnie_Bot` Code of Professional Conduct is licensed under the [CC BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

This privacy policy outlines the ways in which we store and use your data, 

## What we do store

* Discord identifiers
* Challenge and goal history
* Timezone and home server (if you give us that data; we don't extrapolate it)

## What we don't store

* Your Discord display name (queried via API)
* Your server's name (queried via API)
* Any information that you don't explicitly give us

## Who has access

* The core team via Redash (this is currently three people, and that's very unlikely to change)
* Winnie via database queries

## What we use it for

* Winnie's features
* Checking for inappropriate challenge names that we need to filter
* Querying and analytics to help us build out a feature roadmap

## Where we store/process it

* Stored on a server hosted in The Netherlands
* Query server is (presumably?) hosted in the United States of America
* Data is processed locally in Australia and the United States of America

## Data security

* Database access is locked down to the Redash instance and the Winnie droplet (potentially a second droplet that hosts Lily and Marcus in the future - those instances are not public)
* Some data is visible cross-server - server names and raptor totals on the raptor leaderboard, and aggregate server summaries at the end of challenges

## Data exports

* We don't do this automatically yet; it is on the roadmap to allow for automatic challenge and goal history exports to CSV
* You can request all of the data 

## Data deletion

Winnie only stores data that you provide to her, and your data is only stored under the unique identifier that Discord uses for your account. If you wish to request deletion of your user data on the public Winnie_Bot instance, please contact `info at winniebot dot org` with your request.
